## Investigating E.coli efflux transporter diversity 

Scripts written for my second rotation project at Lancaster Universty / LSTM to analyse E. coli efflux transporter diversity 

To re-run the analysis, first run the functions script titled `functions_script_ecoli_efflux_diversity_analysis.R` into your working directory. Then run each each script in order to re-create the analysis and figures. 

In THEORY all these functions should work for any HMMER output. There are additional lines within the code title "JUNK", I kept these in because they offer further analyses that I did, but didn't make it into the final write up. I plan on coming back to these at a later date. 

Any questions please ping me a message
