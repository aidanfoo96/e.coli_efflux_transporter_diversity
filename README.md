## Investigating E.coli efflux transporter diversity 

Scripts written for my second rotation project at the Lancaster Universty / LSTM to analyse E. coli efflux transporter diversity 

To re-run the analyses, first run the functions script titled `functions_script_ecoli_efflux_diversity_analysis.R` into your working directory. Then run each each script in order to re-create the analysis. 

In THEORY all these functions should work for any HMMER output...however, there are definitely (as always) better ways to improve the code. Furthermore, there are additional lines within the code title "JUNK", I kept these in because they offer further anlyses that I did but didn't make it into the final write up. I plan on coming back to these in a later date. 

Any questions please ping me a message
